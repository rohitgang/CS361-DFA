* Authors: Andre Maldonado, Steven Kim, Rohit Gangurde
* Class: CS361 Section 2
* Semester: Spring 2020

## Overview

This Java program implements a deterministic finite automata from an 
input file specifying the final states, start state, additional states and valid transitions. 


## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the project directory:

$ javac fa/dfa/DFADriver.java

Run the class with this command and input file p1tc1.txt :

$ java fa.dfa.DFADriver ./tests/p1tc1.txt
